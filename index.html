              <b>Vidya & Child</b> is a project managed/operated by Jayaprakash Narayan Memorial Trust registered as a Public Charitable Trust in New Delhi, India. The trust is registered u/s 12A and 80G of the Income Tax Act. People, who believe in his ideals and the work that he did, have constituted the Trust in his memory.<br><br>

              Sri Jayaprakash Narayan was one of the greatest political thinkers of Modern India. He was involved deeply in the independence struggle under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and his entire life was devoted to ushering in a new socio-political order, which would bring both freedom and equality to all.<br><br>

              The Trust's objective is towards undertaking development work for the underprivileged, who do not have access to basic amenities like drinking water, health and sanitation facilities and education facilities for children.

            <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Vidya & Child - An Overview</b></u></h4>
            <div class="row" style="width:95%;margin:20px 0px 0px 20px">
              <b>Vidya & Child</b> works with the mission to help bridge the gap for those children who need education and have no access to the facilities for learning existing in our society.  It started in July  1998  to  work  towards  providing  a  learning  environment  that  can  lead  to  a  strong educational foundation as well as help a child in identifying the uniqueness within.<br><br>

              Socio-economic conditions and prevalent mindsets make it impossible for a vast majority of children to go to school. The child is hardly exposed to any form of learning and therefore the personality of the child does not grow. As the child grows in age the earning potential remains the same as that of the parent. <u>The cycle repeats itself generation after generation.</u><br><br>

              The belief that every child is capable of greatness is the driving force which provides a platform wherein every child is given the freedom to explore and take decisions for a meaningful life ahead. Each year their performance, enthusiasm and increased confidence reinforce our belief towards their inherent capabilities and aptitude for excellence.  It is indeed unfortunate that a large majority of children in India are denied this opportunity and have no hope to learn and take advantage of the ever increasing progress made by mankind.<br><br>

              <b>Vidya & Child</b> started with 2 children and now works with over 1,500 children across 6 locations through its non formal and after school support centres. There are over 200 children who have been mainstreamed into formal schools and over 50 children have finished Class XII and are all pursuing higher studies. These are children who belong to socio-economically marginalised sections of society, majority of them have parents who are illiterate/semi-literate and work as domestic servants, industrial workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors, plumbers and carpenters.<br><br>

              Over the last fourteen years we have been able to connect with the parents so that they now send their daughters to study and learn. When we did start our centre many girls who came to us were either school dropouts or had only studied in their village and not continued with their studies after their parents moved to Noida. As a result many of the children who enrolled with us were highly over-aged. However their keenness to learn and conviction to study with much smaller children was in itself a huge learning experience for us. Continuous interaction with parents has ensured that now many enroll their daughters with us at an early age.

              Each child's insatiable energy, determination to succeed and ever smiling faces drives us to improve on our inputs and reinforces our beliefs<b>:-</b><br><br>
              1. Every child has a right to be educated<br>
              2. Every child has capabilities that need to be explored and channelized<br>
              3. Every child dreams and yearns to learn, to make a place for himself in society<br>
              4. We in Vidya & Child can through our small support help them explore their talents to translate into an improved and meaningful life.
